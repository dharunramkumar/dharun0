<p>The Tata Nexon 2025 facelift represents the next evolution of India’s best‑selling compact SUV, combining robust design, advanced technology, and top‑class safety in a single package. With its refreshed exterior, cutting‑edge interiors, and efficient powertrains, the Nexon continues to set benchmarks in its segment.

Externally, the facelifted Nexon adopts a bold new front fascia with a sculpted hood, split LED lighting signature, and a wider gloss‑black grille. Slim LED daytime running lamps sit above the primary headlamps, creating a distinctive “face.” The two‑tone roof option and 16‑ to 18‑inch diamond‑cut alloy wheels add a sporty flair, while crisp character lines along the flanks enhance its muscular stance.

Under the hood, buyers can choose from three powertrain options: a 1.2 L TurboRevotron petrol engine (≈120 PS), a 1.5 L Revotorq diesel unit (≈115 PS), and the all‑electric Nexon.ev with 30 kWh or 40.5 kWh battery packs. Transmission choices include a 6‑speed manual, AMT, dual‑clutch automatic (DCT), and a single‑speed gearbox for the EV. Retuned suspension and precise steering ensure agile handling and confident highway stability.
